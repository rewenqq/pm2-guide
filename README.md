Then what you need to do is to specify the main files of the folders in the ecosystem.config.js file, as follows.
```js
module.exports = {
    apps: [
        {
            name: "takachi-ai",
            namespace: "AI",
            script: 'takachi', //main file
            watch: false,
            exec_mode: "cluster",
            max_memory_restart: "500M",
            cwd: "./takachi-ai" //file path
          },
]
```

### Runing System
If all your config and systems are ready, open CMD using the SHIFT + MAUSE RIGHT shortcut in the folder where the bots are located and
Create a clean package.json file with the npm init -y command.
Then type npm i pm2@latest -g -s after the download is completed.
It will be enough to type pm2 start.
